Can you guess what letter Therman is thinking of? 

In this game you have 9 guesses to figure out which letter Therman is thinking of. If you guess correct in under 9 guesses you gain a win!!! and the game resets. If you run out of guesses before selecting the correct letter you gain a loss :( and the game resets. Play as much as you like!   

Therman is a character in the movie Dinner for Schmucks played by Zack Galifianakis, displayed here in the page's background image, he is a self described master of mind control. Whether you win or lose, Therman will have something to say about it. Challenge him at your peril.
